## üìä What is Parallels Desktop?  

**Parallels Desktop** is a leading virtualization solution for macOS that allows users to install and run full Windows and other operating systems in virtual machines (VMs). It provides tight integration with macOS ‚Äî share files, folders, printers, and peripherals between host and guest systems, and run Windows apps alongside Mac apps without rebooting. Parallels focuses on delivering near-native performance by optimizing virtualization for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs, making it suitable for productivity, testing, development, and legacy app usage.

The platform supports a wide range of use cases: developers can test software across multiple OS versions, IT professionals can maintain compatibility with enterprise tools, designers can run Windows-only creative software, and everyday users can access apps that are not available on macOS. Parallels includes features such as Coherence Mode (run Windows apps like Mac apps), snapshot and cloning capabilities for VM management, seamless copy/paste and drag-and-drop between systems, and extensive hardware passthrough including USB devices and external drives.

Parallels also offers edition tiers (Standard, Pro, Business) with features tailored to different audiences ‚Äî the Pro and Business editions add advanced networking, performance tuning, and team deployment capabilities. Parallels keeps the virtualization experience reliable with regular updates for macOS compatibility, improved performance on Apple Silicon, and built-in tools for creating, managing, and backing up virtual machines ‚Äî making it a comprehensive solution for running alternative OS environments on Mac.
